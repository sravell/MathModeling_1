This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyquant)
library(purrr)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## From these 2 sets of matrices, I can observe that the covariances of the 2-year #matrices are generally higher. The correlation matrices between both are really similar but the 2 year matrices still have higher values on average. The column and row values for each Fund is the same so order does not matter. 

```

```{r}
eg2 <- eigen(cov1)

print("cor eigenpair:")
eg2$values
eg2$vectors

ev2 <- eigen(cov2)
print("cov eigenpair:")
ev2$values
ev2$vectors

## Since the eigenvectors are relatively small and around the same size, that means they spread of data will pull to both sides about the sime on a minute scale
